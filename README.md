## About Me

- I'm currently learning more about web development, specifically web extensions. I've been wanting to try making my own web extensions for a while. I started my first one recently and found it really interesting. 
- I am passionate about exploring the ever-evolving world of technology. Currently, I am diving into web development with a special interest in web extensions. Creating my first web extension has been a fascinating journey, igniting a desire to develop more innovative solutions. My goals are to enhance my skills in this domain, contribute to impactful projects, and eventually lead a team of developers in building cutting-edge web applications. Ask me about my latest project, StayOnTask, a web extension designed to help users maintain focus while working online.
